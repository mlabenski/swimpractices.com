Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mlabenski/swimpractices.com/issues). 

Swim Practices is a side project and solely maintained by the repository owner [mlabenski](https://github.com/mlabenski/). Our mission is to explore generative AI capabilities at generating meaningful swim practices for any proficiency. The tech stack is a vue 2 application deployed using the Nuxt server side rendering tools. While this repository features the web application itself, magic happens behind the scenes with Google Firebase, ChatGPT API, and Replit servers. 


## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases. 

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 

- One or more **product SKU** labels that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below.

- One or more **deployment models** (cloud, server, and/or ae). Where not stated, features will generally come out Cloud first, and follow on Server and GHAE at or soon after GA.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant [Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) post.


## Release phases - For GHES

Some features may be marked with a GHES 3.X label, which indicates that the feature will also become available for Github Enterprise Server customers. Below are the release version numbers and expected release quarters (_Note: these dates are subject to change_). 

**GHES release version dates**:
| **Version Number** | **Release Quarter** | **Release Notes** |
|-|-|-|

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.
